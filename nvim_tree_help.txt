Opening a File

Positioned in the desired folder and with the file selected to be edited, we have the following combinations to open it:

    Enter o o to open the file in a new buffer and place the cursor on the first line of the file
    Tab to open the file in a new buffer while keeping the cursor in nvimtree, this for example is useful if you want to open several files at once
    Ctrl + t to open the file in a new tab that can be managed separately from the other buffers present
    Ctrl + v to open the file in the buffer by dividing it vertically into two parts, if there was already an open file this will be displayed side by side with the new file
    Ctrl + h to open the file like the command described above but dividing the buffer horizontally

File Management
The keys for modification are:

    a (add) allows the creation of files or folders, creating a folder is done by following the name with the slash /. 
                  E.g. /nvchad/nvimtree.md will create the related markdown file while /nvchad/nvimtree/ will create the nvimtree folder.
                  The creation will occur by default at the location where the cursor is in the file explorer at that time,
                  so the selection of the folder where to create the file will have to be done previously or alternatively
                  you can write the full path in the statusline, in writing the path you can make use of the auto-complete function

    r (rename) to rename the selected file from the original name

    Ctrl + r to rename the file regardless of its original name

    d (delete) to delete the selected file or in case of a folder delete the folder with all its contents

    x (cut) to cut and copy the selection to the clipboard, can be files or folders with all its contents,
                  with this command associated with the paste command you make the file moves within the tree

    c (copy) like the previous command this copies the file to the clipboard but keeps the original file in its location

    p (paste) to paste the contents of the clipboard to the current location

    y to copy only the file name to the clipboard, there are also two variants which are Y to copy the relative path and g + y to copy the absolute path
